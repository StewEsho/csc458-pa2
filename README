ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS
=========================

Q1)
    When the queue size increases, so to does the time it takes to fetch a web page.
    This is because new packet sent must wait at the END of the queue for all the packets ahead of it to be delivered.
    A larger queue size means this packet may potentially need to wait for a greater amount of packets ahead of it.
    As well, the larger queue size means the queue will hit its limit later, meaning TCP Reno will reduce cwnd less often, 
    thus causing the switch's queue to stay congested for longer periods of time (compared to if the max queue size was smaller).

    An analogy for this behaviour is waiting behind a longer line at a grocery store, which would increase the amount of time needed to checkout.

Q2)
    The VM's maximum transmit queue length (txqueuelen) is 1000 packets, with a maximum transmission unit of 1500 bytes.
    Thus, a fully maxed out queue can potentially store 1,500,000 bytes, or 12 megabits. 
    With a clear rate of 100Mb/s, the queue could potentially take 0.12s (120ms) to completely clear out.
